# iPSC_neuron_dev
Work done during my rotation in the Starita Lab in Fall 2024 at the University of Washington Department of Genome Sciences.
All code was written in conjunction with Mary O'Neill from the Brotman Baty Institute. 
All data used was obtained from Shawn Fayer, Rhiddaman Garge, Abby McGee, and Evan McDermott from the University of Washington. 
Additional iPSC-neuron data was used from the Treutlein Lab. Find paper here - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34358451/.
The goal of this project was to find where gene expression changes occur during iPSC-neuron differentiation using the NGN2 pathway.
This was the prep work for a new assay to uncover the purposes of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs).
In this repository is some previous versions of the final code, with the final product as treutlein_x_crispr_screen.
